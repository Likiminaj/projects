42 School projects covering C programming fundamentals, memory management, UNIX systems, and algorithmic thinking, built under strict constraints and evaluation standards.

# 42 School Projects

This repository contains projects completed as part of the **42 School curriculum**, focused on low-level programming, systems fundamentals, and algorithmic problem-solving in C.

---

## Curriculum Overview

42 School’s curriculum is structured into progressive ranks, each increasing in technical depth, constraints, and system-level understanding.

---

## Rank 00
- **Libft** – Custom implementation of standard C library functions

---

## Rank 01
- **get_next_line** – Reading from file descriptors line by line
- **ft_printf** – Reimplementation of the `printf` function

---

## Rank 02
- **Born2BeRoot** – Linux system administration, virtualization, and security basics
- **push_swap** – Sorting algorithms under constrained operations
- **Exam Rank 02** – Timed algorithmic and C programming assessment

---

## Rank 03 (WIP)
- **minishell** *(WIP)* – Building a Unix shell (lexing, parsing, execution, signals)
- **philosophers** *(WIP)* – Concurrency, threading, and synchronization
- **Exam Rank 03** *(WIP)* – Timed systems programming assessment

---

## Skills & Concepts Covered
- C programming and manual memory management
- UNIX systems and process control
- Parsing, lexing, and shell execution
- Multithreading and synchronization primitives
- Algorithmic thinking and complexity analysis
- Defensive programming under strict constraints

---

## Notes
- All projects follow **42 School norms** and peer-evaluation standards.
- Projects marked **WIP** are actively being developed.
- This repository is maintained for learning and portfolio purposes.
